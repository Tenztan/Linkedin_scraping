## Description

This repository contains scripts for scraping user data from LinkedIn using two different approaches: LinkedIn API and browser automation with Selenium. The scripts allow users to input a person's first and last name and retrieve relevant data for the first 10 search results, which are then saved in a CSV file. The project is designed to assess skills in API integration, browser automation, data scraping, and basic problem-solving.
The repository includes two scripts:

1. **Script 1: LinkedIn API**
   - This script utilizes the LinkedIn API to search for users based on the provided first and last name.
   - It retrieves data for the first 10 search results and saves details of the first 10 relevant users in a CSV file.
   - Extra feature Login attempt's to not get detected for bot activity and getpass to secure your password API 

2. **Script 2: Browser Automation with Selenium**
   - This script automates a web browser using Selenium to navigate to LinkedIn's search page.
   - It searches for users based on the provided first and last name, retrieves data for the first 10 search results, and saves it to a CSV file.
   - Extra feature fake_useragent to bypass bot detection
